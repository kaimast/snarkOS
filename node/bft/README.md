The `snarkos-node-bft` crate provides a node implementation for a BFT-based memory pool.

## Primary

The primary is the coordinator, responsible for advancing rounds and broadcasting the anchor.

#### Triggering Round Advancement

Each round runs until one of two conditions is met:
1. The coinbase target has been reached, or
2. The round has reached its timeout (currently set to 10 seconds)

#### Advancing Rounds

As described in the paper [Bullshark: The Partially Synchronous Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05633),
the BFT generally advances rounds when `n − f` vertices are delivered, however:
```
The problem in advancing rounds whenever n − f vertices are delivered is that parties
might not vote for the anchor even if the party that broadcast it is just slightly slower
than the fastest n − f parties. To deal with this, the BFT integrates timeouts into
the DAG construction. If the first n − f vertices a party p gets in an even-numbered round r 
do not include the anchor of round r, then p sets a timer and waits for the anchor
until the timer expires. Similarly, in an odd-numbered round, parties wait for either
f + 1 vertices that vote for the anchor, or 2f + 1 vertices that do not, or a timeout.
```
Note that in this quote `2f + 1` should really be `n - f`.

### Ledger Advancement

The BFT module also advances the ledger as new certificates are added to the DAG. There are two different ways the ledger can advance.

#### 1. Consensus Path (Normal Operation)

When the node is actively participating in consensus and is synced with the network:

1. **Certificate Collection**: The Primary receives batch certificates from validators and inserts them into the DAG via `update_dag()`.
2. **Leader Election**: Leaders are elected in even rounds. When a certificate arrives for round `r`, the BFT checks if the leader certificate for round `r-1` can be committed.
3. **Availability Threshold**: The leader certificate is ready to commit when the availability threshold is reached—i.e., enough validators in round `r` have included the leader's certificate in their previous certificate IDs.
4. **Commit Chain**: `commit_leader_certificate()` is called, which:
   - Walks backwards through the DAG to find all uncommitted leader certificates that are linked to the current one
   - Builds a subDAG containing all certificates to be committed
   - Sends the subDAG to the Consensus module via `tx_consensus_subdag`
5. **Block Creation**: The Consensus module receives the subDAG and calls `try_advance_to_next_block()`, which:
   - Prepares a new block from the subDAG and its transmissions
   - Validates and advances the ledger to the new block

#### 2. Sync Path (Catching Up)

When the node is behind and syncing blocks from peers, the `bft::Sync` module handles synchronization. The behavior differs based on how far behind the node is:

##### Within GC Range (Normal Sync)

When the node is within the garbage collection range of the network tip:

1. **Block Reception**: `bft::Sync` requests and receives blocks from peer nodes via `BlockSync`.
2. **Certificate Insertion**: Each certificate from the block's subDAG is added to the BFT's DAG via the `SyncCallback::add_new_certificates()` trait method. This populates the DAG with the certificates needed for consensus.
3. **BFT-Driven Ledger Advancement**: The BFT module handles block creation through its normal consensus path—when enough certificates are added to the DAG, the BFT commits leader certificates and creates blocks just as it does during normal operation.
4. **Pending Blocks**: Blocks are verified using `check_block_subdag()` and added to a queue of `pending_blocks`. This step is needed in case the node switches back to block-based fast sync.
5. **Pending Block Cleanup**: When the ledger advances because of leader commits (see 3), pending blocks are removed from the queue.

##### Outside GC Range (Fast Sync)
When the node is too far behind (outside the GC range):

1. **Block Reception**: `bft::Sync` requests and receives blocks from peer nodes via `BlockSync` (same as with normal sync).
2. **No DAG Updates**: Certificates are **not** added to the BFT's DAG, since they are too old to be useful for consensus.
3. **Pending Blocks**: Blocks are verified using `check_block_subdag()` and added to a queue of `pending_blocks` (same as with normal sync).
4. **Availability Threshold Check**: The Sync module checks whether each pending block's leader certificate has reached the availability threshold. This requires certificates from subsequent blocks that reference the leader certificate.
5. **Ledger Advancement**: Once the availability threshold is confirmed, the Sync module directly advances the ledger by calling `advance_to_next_block()` for each confirmed block, and updates storage height and round.
6. **Transition to Normal Sync**: Once the node catches up to within the GC range, it runs the bootup synchronization routine and switches back to normal BFT-driven sync.

## Workers

The workers are simple entry replicators that receive transactions from the network and append them to their memory pool.

In order to function properly, workers must be synced to the latest round, and capable of performing verification
on the entries they receive from other validators' workers.

## Test Cases

- Two validators, one with X workers, another with Y workers. Check that they are compatible.
- If a primary sees that f+1 other primaries have certified this round, it should skip to the next round if it has not been certified yet.
- Ensure taking a set number of transmissions from workers leaves the remaining transmissions in place for the next round.
- Send back a mismatching transmission for a transmission ID, ensure it catches it.
- Send back a mismatching certificate for a certificate ID, ensure it catches it.

## Open Questions

1. How does one guarantee the number of accepted transactions and solutions does not exceed the block limits?
   - We need to set limits on the number of transmissions for the workers, but also the primary.
